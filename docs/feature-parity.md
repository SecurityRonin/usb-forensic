# Feature-Parity Matrix

The goal: the most comprehensive USB-device-history analyzer available — matching or
exceeding every dedicated competitor, then adding the pipeline/reproducibility wedge no
incumbent has. This page is the **authoritative checklist**: every row is a capability
one of the reference tools ships, and the status column tracks `usb-forensic` against it.

Status legend: ✅ implemented & tested · 🏗 build in progress · 📋 planned · — not applicable.
No cell is marked ✅ until it is implemented **and** validated against an independent
oracle (see [validation](validation.md)).

Reference tools absorbed: **USB Detective** (the depth/scoring leader), **USB Forensic
Tracker / USBFT** (breadth: multi-OS, image mounting, VSCs, encrypted-volume history),
**USB Historian**, **USBDeview**, **KAPE + RegRipper / Registry Explorer**.

## 2. Windows artifact coverage

| Artifact | Signal | Seen in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `USBSTOR` (SYSTEM) | device class/serial/VID-PID, first/last connect | all dedicated | ✅ (`PeripheralSource` via `peripheral-core` registry reader; regipy-validated) |
| `Enum\USB` (SYSTEM) | parent USB device, container id | USB Detective, RegRipper | ✅ (same reader) |
| **`Enum\SCSI`** (UASP / USB-3 drives) | modern drives absent from `USBSTOR` | (gap in most) | ✅ (same reader; Szechuan VMware disk validated) |
| `MountedDevices` (SYSTEM) | drive-letter ↔ device mapping | USB Detective, USBFT, RegRipper | ✅ (`peripheral-core` 0.3 decodes device-path entries → `DriveLetter` claim; Szechuan `D:`→CD-ROM validated) |
| `WPDBUSENUM` / Windows Portable Devices (SOFTWARE) | MTP/PTP + mass-storage, volume label | USB Detective, USBFT | 📋 |
| `VolumeInfoCache` + `EMDMgmt` (SOFTWARE) | volume label ↔ serial history | USB Detective | ✅ (`VolumeCacheSource` (label by drive letter) + `EmdMgmtSource` (label + 4-byte volume serial, the LNK `DriveSerialNumber` join key) via `peripheral-core` 0.4/0.7. Tier-1 on the real NIST CFReDS SOFTWARE hive: `Authorized USB`/1551191358 and `IAMAN $_@`/2657770370, matching the answer key) |
| `MountPoints2` (NTUSER.DAT) | per-user mounts | USB Detective, USBFT, RegRipper | ✅ (`MountPoints2Source` via `peripheral-core` 0.6; per-user volume-GUID mount + time, unified with the drive letter & label by the MountedDevices MBR-signature bridge. Tier-1 on the real NIST CFReDS: informant mounted `{a2f2048e}` = E: = `IAMAN $_@` at 2015-03-24 21:02:33) |
| `Amcache.hve` | execution / first-seen corroboration | USB Detective | 📋 |
| SetupAPI (`setupapi.dev.log`) | first-install time (local, TZ-normalized) | all dedicated | ✅ (`PeripheralSource`) |
| Linux kernel log (`syslog`/`dmesg`) | USB enumeration (VID/PID, serial, first-seen) | USBFT (parses) | ✅ (`PeripheralSource` via `peripheral-core` `linux_syslog`; UAC-syslog validated) |
| Partition/Diagnostic event log | volume serial numbers, connect events | USB Detective | ✅ (`PartitionDiagSource` via `winevt-extract` 0.3 EID-1006 extractor; disk-arrival connect events, Tier-1 on the real DFIRArtifactMuseum `.evtx`. Volume-serial VBR decode: follow-up) |
| Other USB event-log providers (Kernel-PnP, DriverFrameworks-UserMode, Ntfs) | connect/disconnect, mount | RegRipper/KAPE workflows | 📋 |
| LNK files | files opened on device (volume-serial join) | USB Detective, USBFT | ✅ (`LnkSource`) |
| Jump Lists | recent items per app on device | USB Detective | ✅ (`JumpListSource`, MRU access times) |
| ShellBags | folders browsed on device | USB Detective, USBFT | 📋 |

## 3. Correlation & scoring (the moat)

| Capability | Seen in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Merge all sources into one per-device record | USB Detective | ✅ (`correlate` / `correlate_sources`) |
| Cross-source timestamp comparison per attribute | USB Detective | ✅ core primitive (`Consistency`) |
| Consistency grading (corroborated / conflicting / single-source) | USB Detective (colour-coded) | ✅ `Consistency` |
| Anti-forensics / tampering leads (impossible timestamp ordering) | USB Detective (timestamp scoring) | ✅ (`audit` `USB-IMPOSSIBLE-ORDERING`: first-connect after last-connect → MITRE T1070.006) |
| Per-value source provenance retained | USB Detective | ✅ (`ProvenancedValue`: source + locator) |
| Reproducibility chain (raw bytes → decoding rule per value) | (none) | 📋 the wedge |
| Deleted / removed-device recovery (Win10 cleanup) | USB Detective | 📋 |
| Prior volume names/serials for formatted devices | USB Detective | 📋 |
| Device/volume encryption-type detection | USB Detective | 📋 |
| TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt mounted-volume history | USBFT | 📋 |
| File-to-device linking (which files touched which stick) | USB Detective, USBFT | ✅ (`reconcile_volume_serials` — LNK volume-keyed file access re-attributed to the device carrying that volume serial; ambiguous/unmatched left untouched. Rule-tested; end-to-end join needs a FAT-volume + LNK corpus) |
| Timezone normalization (local ↔ UTC) | USB Detective | ✅ (`--tz-offset`; `clock_is_local` per source) |
| OS-version-aware artifact semantics | USB Detective | 📋 |

## 4. Cross-platform evidence (USBFT breadth)

Per-OS modules report what each system actually retains, with **explicit retention
windows** — a timestamped event list, not a fabricated consistency score where the
sources cannot support one (see [roadmap](roadmap.md) Phase 3).

| Source | OS | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Unified logs (USBMSC), `/var/log/daily.out`, IORegistry snapshots, `com.apple.iPod.plist` | macOS | 📋 |
| syslog/dmesg kernel USB blocks (journald/GVFS planned) | Linux | ✅ wired end-to-end (`peripheral-core` `linux_syslog`, `--year`); UAC-syslog validated |

## 5. Output & reporting

| Capability | Seen in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Results grid / high-level report | USB Detective, USBFT, Historian, USBDeview | ✅ (`usb4n6 --table`) |
| Verbose per-value report with provenance | USB Detective | ✅ (`usb4n6 --report`) |
| Per-device timeline | USB Detective | ✅ (per-device JSONL / report block) |
| Aggregate super-timeline | USB Detective | ✅ (`usb4n6 --timeline`; every timestamped event across all devices, chronological JSONL) |
| Opened/accessed-files report | USB Detective | 📋 |
| Machine-readable output (JSONL, diffable, pipeable) | (weak in all — Excel/CSV only) | ✅ (`to_jsonl`, default) |
| `forensicnomicon::report` findings (fleet-uniform, MITRE-tagged) | (fleet-only) | ✅ (`audit`) |
| Court-ready report with per-value source chain | (Excel only elsewhere) | ✅ native **DOCX + PDF** (`--docx`/`--pdf`, both oracle-validated) + Markdown (`--report`) |
| Volume / MBR export | USB Detective | 📋 |
| Differential mode vs USB Detective / RegRipper (validation) | (none) | 📋 |

## 6. Engineering posture (the fleet differentiators)

| Property | Status |
|---|---|
| Single static binary, no runtime deps, `cargo install` | 🏗 (`usb4n6` builds & runs; `cargo install` at publish) |
| Library-embeddable (used by Issen / other fleet crates) | ✅ (this crate) |
| `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, panic-free (unwrap/expect denied) | ✅ |
| 100% line coverage gate | ✅ |
| Fuzzed at every parse boundary | 📋 (upstream reader crates + own adapters) |
| Validated against independent oracle on real images | 📋 |

---

The correlation **core** (source-agnostic: claims → consistency + provenance → findings)
is the highest-leverage work; every artifact row above becomes "add a `HistorySource`"
once it is solid. That is what is being built first.
